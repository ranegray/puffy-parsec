what is rgrl?

an undergraduate student starting a robotics lab seems a little bit weird?

if i dont start it now, when would i?

the logistics of starting a robotics lab, yeah while i dont know a ton about this i do intend to learn quite a bit. 

i want to expand my knowledge of robotics and i want to do it in a way that is open and collaborative.

i want to be able to go around to schools and teach kids and get them interested in this sort of thing. its the future. and its so damn cool. they will see the passion.

teaching people on streams how they can do it for themselves if they just had the drive to do it would be very fun.

selling kits to schools. or partnering with schools to get them robotics kits. i dont know. i want to be able to do something like that.

there is this overall desire to remove the stigma of robotics being very difficult to get into. also that humanoids are very capital intensive. we need a way to skill people up so they can get humanoids into their own homes. train them in their day to day lives. but there very obviously needs to be some guard rails in place. i suppose any new technology is very dangerous and can be used for nefaious purposes. but i think putting the power in the hands of the people just like with cars or whatever else. we would just need to be careful about reducing access to nefaiourous actors. just like with cars or whatever.

what is rgrl?
it early. its a robotics lab. it is a place where i can do research and development on robotics. it is a place where i can teach people about robotics. it is a place where i can build things. it is a place where i can learn things. it is a place where i can share things. it is a place where i can collaborate with others. it is a place where i can make things happen. it is a place where i can be creative.

what will it be?
ideally, it will become the place where anyone can come and learn about robotics. it will be a place where people can come and build things. it will be a place where people can come and share their ideas. it will be a place where people can come and collaborate with others. it will be a place where people can come and make things happen. it will be a place where people can come and be creative. together we can democratize huamnoid robotics and capture value for the people.
