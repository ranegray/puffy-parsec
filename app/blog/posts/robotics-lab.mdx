i wanted to talk about setting up this robotics lab in my small ass apartment here in BOulder, CO. 

rgrl v0.1

the beginnings of an indie robotics research lab. the rane gray robotics lab.

I'll dive into my setup:
- computer
- 3d printer
- robot bases
    - irobot create3
    - lerobot so-101 arms
- monitor
- streaming setup
- organization
