# Assembling a mobile robotics lab for my small apartment

Published on: {pubDate}

## tools i already have

## tools i need

## what i want to do

my desire is to become an experienced robotics software engineer. what better way to do that than to build robots at home. i have a small apartment, so i need to be mindful of the space i take up. i also have a small budget, so i need to be mindful of the money i spend.

## workflow

ill be following along with a raspberry pi and arduino robotics book i got from the library.
